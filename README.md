Reflector - A lightweight reflection library for [GWT](http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/ "GWT Homepage")
====================================================

GWT does not implement the [Java Reflection API](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/package-summary.html).
This project provides a very simple replacement. 

The goals of the project are:
*  Not to implement the whole of the reflection API
*  Provide an easy way to read and write properties of JavaBean like objects
*  Provide an easy way to read the type of properties of JavaBean like objects
